class EntryPointScanner(BaseScanner):
    """
    Detects actionable entry points on stocks in a confirmed uptrend.

    Looks for price approaching or touching daily MA10/MA20 with signs of
    holding support -- either the candle is near the MA, or a hammer/dragonfly
    doji (reversed T) formed with its wick testing the MA.

    Trend filter (must pass):
      - Daily MA10 > MA20 > MA50 (strong daily structure)
      - Weekly close > weekly MA20 (intermediate uptrend intact)
      - Full weekly alignment (close > w10 > w20) earns bonus points

    Entry signals (scored independently, best signal wins):
      1. APPROACHING: close within approach_pct% of MA10/MA20 (above or below)
      2. TOUCH: candle low reached MA10/MA20 but close held near/above it
      3. HAMMER: long lower wick tested MA10/MA20, close near candle high
         (the "reversed T" / dragonfly doji pattern)

    A hammer at the MA is the strongest signal because it shows sellers
    pushed price to the MA and got rejected. Price slightly below MA10
    is allowed since that IS the entry zone -- close must stay above MA20.
