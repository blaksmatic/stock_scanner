    Finds very strong tickers that pull back to daily MA10/MA20 and bounce,
    confirmed by bullish weekly MA structure.

    Weekly filter:
      - Weekly close > weekly MA10 > weekly MA20 > weekly MA40
      - Ensures the stock is in a strong intermediate uptrend

    Daily trigger:
      - Daily MA10 > MA20 > MA50 (strong daily trend)
      - Price dipped to touch or pierce MA10/MA20 in the last N days
        (low <= MA within touch_pct%)
      - Price has bounced: latest close is back above the MA it touched
      - Close > Open on the latest bar (green candle = buying pressure)

    Scoring:
      - Tighter touch = higher score
      - Weekly MA spread (strength of weekly trend)
      - Bounce strength (how far above the touched MA)
